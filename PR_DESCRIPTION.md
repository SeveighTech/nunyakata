### Test Commands

```bash
# Full comprehensive test suite
python3 run_tests.py

# Quick development validation
make test-runner-fast

# Code quality checks only
make test-runner-lint

# Tests with coverage reporting
python3 run_tests.py --coverage

# Shell wrapper interface
./test.sh --fast

# Original pytest command
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/nunyakata --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=70

# Configuration tests specifically
python3 -m pytest tests/test_config.py -v

# Type checking and linting
python3 -m mypy src/nunyakata
python3 -m flake8 src/
python3 -m black --check src/ tests/
```

## Breaking Changes

- [x] No breaking changes
- [ ] Breaking changes (describe below):

**Note**: All changes are backward-compatible. Parameter renames in internal configuration functions align with the NaloSolutions class interface but don't affect public API.

## Documentation

- [x] Code comments updated
- [ ] README.md updated
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Examples updated
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [x] No documentation changes needed

**New Documentation Added**:
- `TEST_RUNNERS.md`: Comprehensive guide for using the test runner suite
- Enhanced docstrings in configuration functions
- Improved error messages and validation feedback

## Dependencies

- [x] No new dependencies
- [ ] New dependencies added:
- [ ] Dependency versions updated:

**Note**: All new functionality uses existing dependencies. The test runner leverages already-installed development dependencies.
